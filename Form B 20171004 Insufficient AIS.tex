Information and Data Checked: &
\begin{minipage}[t]{110mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automatic Identification System (AIS)
\item Data Daily SkyPier HSF movements
  \item Record of potential deviations
\item Response provided by the ferry operators

Case No: & \textit{SPNC-874}

Date: & \textit{4 October 2017}
\\ \hline
Ferry Details: & Ferry Number: 3A167
\newline Average Speed: 13.5 knots\newline Range of Instantaneous Speed: 13 -- 14 knots\newline Duration of Instantaneous Speeding: 2
\\ \hline
Comments and Observations \newline From ET: & Insufficient AIS data was recorded. The AIS signals could not be received which might due to interference effect. Based on available AIS data, the speed and route of vessel could not be analyzed whether it had any deviation within the Speed Control Zone (SCZ). Vessel captain has provided the AIS plots which indicated the vessel entered the SCZ though the gate access point and no speeding in the SCZ was observed. Ferry operator should investigate the reason for the AIS failure and check the AIS system to ensure that sufficient data points can be received. \\ \hline
